So, I have finally joined GitHub after downloading oh so many things from it. I may be interested in coding one day, but I do not plan to for now. I have simply made an account to send issues about the projects I do use on GitHub, and this account serves as a account to go to when I am interested in making projects.

Blaze6265/Blaze6265 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
